<h2>A Multivariate Linear Model to Predict Computer Endpoint Counts Based on Employee Headcount</h2>
<br />
<h3>Background</h3>
<br />
I work at a large university that has many divisions which are very much decentralized from one another when it comes to things like IT and IT security. Each division has its own IT support groups, its own way of maintaining inventory, its own priorities and objectives when it comes to all things technical. Often, there is even further decentralization within divisions, with departments within them doing their own thing. This has its benefits, but it often makes it difficult for units whose job it is to perform central services.<br />
<br />
In my role as a cybersecurity analyst, I'm confronted by this fact daily. Our office is ultimately responsible for the overall security of the university, yet we often lack the visibility into or the authority over its divisions and departments. And while we're asked to report on the overall security posture of the university, it's often somewhat of a guessing game.<br />
<br />
One aspect of that security posture is in the realm of endpoint security. Our office contracts with security software vendors to license tools such as malware prevention, firewall services, and vulnerability management. We can't force divisions or departments to use them, but we make them available and we strongly encourage their use.<br />
<br />
Recently, we have advocated for a stronger, more active approach to deploying these tools to university endpoints. As with any such effort, leadership is interested in gauging progress, namely how many of the university's endpoints are using the security tools, and how many more do we have to go for a "full" deployment.<br />
